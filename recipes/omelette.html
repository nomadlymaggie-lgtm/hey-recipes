    <p>A simple omelette recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>filling(s) of choice, like cheese or meat</li>
        </ul>
    </h2>
    <h3>Steps
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk the eggs, salt, and pepper together until lightly frothy.</li>
            <li>In an 8-inch non-stick pan, heat the butter over medium-low heat. Pour in the eggs and tilt the pan to make sure they're evenly spread out, then turn the heat down to low. Cook the omelette for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the edges are cooked through and the top is slightly wet but not runny.</li>
            <li>If you'd like to add filling, add it to half of the omelette. Then use a spatula to fold the empty half on top and slide the omelette onto a plate.</li>
        </ol>
